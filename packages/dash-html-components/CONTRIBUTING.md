# Contributing to dash-html-components

## Getting Started

Refer to the [readme](README.md) for installation and development workflow instructions.

## Contributions

[Dash HTML Components][] consist of generic HTML5 elements based on the [MDN spec][] (also see the [W3 index of elements][]). For more complex UI components, see the [Dash Core Components][]. Contributions are welcome! This repository's open [issues][] are a good place to start.

## Coding Style

Please lint any additions to react components with `npm run lint`. Rules defined in [.eslintrc](.eslintrc) are inherited from [`dash-components-archetype`](https://github.com/plotly/dash-components-archetype)'s [eslintrc-react.json][]

## Pull Request Guidelines

Use the [GitHub flow][] when proposing contributions to this repository (i.e. create a feature branch and submit a PR against the master branch).
