## Analytical Web Apps for Python

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/plotly/dash.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/plotly/dash)

Dash is a Python library for creating analytical web-based applications.
 Here’s a 43-line example of a Dash App that ties a Dropdown to a D3.js Plotly Graph.
 As the user selects a value in the Dropdown, the application code dynamically
 exports data from Google Finance into a Pandas DataFrame. This app was written in just 43 lines of code ([view the source](https://gist.github.com/chriddyp/3d2454905d8f01886d651f207e2419f0)).

Dash app code is declarative and reactive, which makes it easy to build complex apps that contain many interactive elements. Here’s an example with 5 inputs, 3 outputs, and cross filtering. This app was composed in just 160 lines of code, all of which were Python.
