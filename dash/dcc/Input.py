class Input(Component):
    """An Input component.
    A basic HTML input control for entering text, numbers, or passwords.

    Note that checkbox and radio types are supported through
    the Checklist and RadioItems component. Dates, times, and file uploads
    are also supported through separate components.

    Keyword arguments:

    - value (string | number; optional):
        The value of the input.

    - type (a value equal to: 'text', 'number', 'password', 'email', 'range', 'search', 'tel', 'url', 'hidden'; default 'text'):
        The type of control to render.

    - debounce (boolean | number; default False):
        If True, changes to input will be sent back to the Dash server
        only on enter or when losing focus. If it's False, it will send
        the value back on every change. If a number, it will not send
        anything back to the Dash server until the user has stopped typing
        for that number of seconds.

    - placeholder (string | number; optional):
        A hint to the user of what can be entered in the control . The
        placeholder text must not contain carriage returns or line-feeds.
        Note: Do not use the placeholder attribute instead of a <label>
        element, their purposes are different. The <label> attribute
        describes the role of the form element (i.e. it indicates what
        kind of information is expected), and the placeholder attribute is
        a hint about the format that the content should take. There are
        cases in which the placeholder attribute is never displayed to the
        user, so the form must be understandable without it.

    - n_submit (number; default 0):
        Number of times the `Enter` key was pressed while the input had
        focus.

    - n_submit_timestamp (number; default -1):
        Last time that `Enter` was pressed.

    - inputMode (a value equal to: 'verbatim', 'latin', 'latin-name', 'latin-prose', 'full-width-latin', 'kana', 'katakana', 'numeric', 'tel', 'email', 'url'; optional):
        Provides a hint to the browser as to the type of data that might
        be entered by the user while editing the element or its contents.

    - autoComplete (string; optional):
        This attribute indicates whether the value of the control can be
        automatically completed by the browser.

    - readOnly (boolean | a value equal to: 'readOnly', 'readonly', 'READONLY'; optional):
        This attribute indicates that the user cannot modify the value of
        the control. The value of the attribute is irrelevant. If you need
        read-write access to the input value, do not add the \"readonly\"
        attribute. It is ignored if the value of the type attribute is
        hidden, range, color, checkbox, radio, file, or a button type
        (such as button or submit). readOnly is an HTML boolean attribute
        - it is enabled by a boolean or 'readOnly'. Alternative
        capitalizations `readonly` & `READONLY` are also acccepted.

    - required (a value equal to: 'required', 'REQUIRED' | boolean; optional):
        This attribute specifies that the user must fill in a value before
        submitting a form. It cannot be used when the type attribute is
        hidden, image, or a button type (submit, reset, or button). The
        :optional and :required CSS pseudo-classes will be applied to the
        field as appropriate. required is an HTML boolean attribute - it
        is enabled by a boolean or 'required'. Alternative capitalizations
        `REQUIRED` are also acccepted.

    - autoFocus (a value equal to: 'autoFocus', 'autofocus', 'AUTOFOCUS' | boolean; optional):
        The element should be automatically focused after the page loaded.
        autoFocus is an HTML boolean attribute - it is enabled by a
        boolean or 'autoFocus'. Alternative capitalizations `autofocus` &
        `AUTOFOCUS` are also acccepted.

    - disabled (a value equal to: 'disabled', 'DISABLED' | boolean; optional):
        If True, the input is disabled and can't be clicked on. disabled
        is an HTML boolean attribute - it is enabled by a boolean or
        'disabled'. Alternative capitalizations `DISABLED`.

    - list (string; optional):
        Identifies a list of pre-defined options to suggest to the user.
        The value must be the id of a <datalist> element in the same
        document. The browser displays only options that are valid values
        for this input element. This attribute is ignored when the type
        attribute's value is hidden, checkbox, radio, file, or a button
        type.

    - multiple (boolean; optional):
        This Boolean attribute indicates whether the user can enter more
        than one value. This attribute applies when the type attribute is
        set to email or file, otherwise it is ignored.

    - spellCheck (a value equal to: 'true', 'false' | boolean; optional):
        Setting the value of this attribute to True indicates that the
        element needs to have its spelling and grammar checked. The value
        default indicates that the element is to act according to a
        default behavior, possibly based on the parent element's own
        spellcheck value. The value False indicates that the element
        should not be checked.

    - name (string; optional):
        The name of the control, which is submitted with the form data.

    - min (string | number; optional):
        The minimum (numeric or date-time) value for this item, which must
        not be greater than its maximum (max attribute) value.

    - max (string | number; optional):
        The maximum (numeric or date-time) value for this item, which must
        not be less than its minimum (min attribute) value.

    - step (string | number; default 'any'):
        Works with the min and max attributes to limit the increments at
        which a numeric or date-time value can be set. It can be the
        string any or a positive floating point number. If this attribute
        is not set to any, the control accepts only values at multiples of
        the step value greater than the minimum.

    - minLength (string | number; optional):
        If the value of the type attribute is text, email, search,
        password, tel, or url, this attribute specifies the minimum number
        of characters (in Unicode code points) that the user can enter.
        For other control types, it is ignored.

    - maxLength (string | number; optional):
        If the value of the type attribute is text, email, search,
        password, tel, or url, this attribute specifies the maximum number
        of characters (in UTF-16 code units) that the user can enter. For
        other control types, it is ignored. It can exceed the value of the
        size attribute. If it is not specified, the user can enter an
        unlimited number of characters. Specifying a negative number
        results in the default behavior (i.e. the user can enter an
        unlimited number of characters). The constraint is evaluated only
        when the value of the attribute has been changed.

    - pattern (string; optional):
        A regular expression that the control's value is checked against.
        The pattern must match the entire value, not just some subset. Use
        the title attribute to describe the pattern to help the user. This
        attribute applies when the value of the type attribute is text,
        search, tel, url, email, or password, otherwise it is ignored. The
        regular expression language is the same as JavaScript RegExp
        algorithm, with the 'u' parameter that makes it treat the pattern
        as a sequence of unicode code points. The pattern is not
        surrounded by forward slashes.

    - selectionStart (string; optional):
        The offset into the element's text content of the first selected
        character. If there's no selection, this value indicates the
        offset to the character following the current text input cursor
        position (that is, the position the next character typed would
        occupy).

    - selectionEnd (string; optional):
        The offset into the element's text content of the last selected
        character. If there's no selection, this value indicates the
        offset to the character following the current text input cursor
        position (that is, the position the next character typed would
        occupy).

    - selectionDirection (string; optional):
        The direction in which selection occurred. This is \"forward\" if
        the selection was made from left-to-right in an LTR locale or
        right-to-left in an RTL locale, or \"backward\" if the selection
        was made in the opposite direction. On platforms on which it's
        possible this value isn't known, the value can be \"none\"; for
        example, on macOS, the default direction is \"none\", then as the
        user begins to modify the selection using the keyboard, this will
        change to reflect the direction in which the selection is
        expanding.

    - n_blur (number; default 0):
        Number of times the input lost focus.

    - n_blur_timestamp (number; default -1):
        Last time the input lost focus.

    - size (string; optional):
        The initial size of the control. This value is in pixels unless
        the value of the type attribute is text or password, in which case
        it is an integer number of characters. Starting in, this attribute
        applies only when the type attribute is set to text, search, tel,
        url, email, or password, otherwise it is ignored. In addition, the
        size must be greater than zero. If you do not specify a size, a
        default value of 20 is used.' simply states \"the user agent
        should ensure that at least that many characters are visible\",
        but different characters can have different widths in certain
        fonts. In some browsers, a certain string with x characters will
        not be entirely visible even if size is defined to at least x.

    - className (string; optional):
        The class of the input element.

    - id (string; optional):
        The ID of this component, used to identify dash components in
        callbacks. The ID needs to be unique across all of the components
        in an app.

    - persistence (boolean | string | number; optional):
        Used to allow user interactions in this component to be persisted
        when the component - or the page - is refreshed. If `persisted` is
        truthy and hasn't changed from its previous value, a `value` that
        the user has changed while using the app will keep that change, as
        long as the new `value` also matches what was given originally.
        Used in conjunction with `persistence_type`.

    - persisted_props (list of a value equal to: 'value's; default ['value']):
        Properties whose user interactions will persist after refreshing
        the component or the page. Since only `value` is allowed this prop
        can normally be ignored.

    - persistence_type (a value equal to: 'local', 'session', 'memory'; default 'local'):
        Where persisted user changes will be stored: memory: only kept in
        memory, reset on page refresh. local: window.localStorage, data is
        kept after the browser quit. session: window.sessionStorage, data
        is cleared once the browser quit."""
